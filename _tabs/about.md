Two years ago, I didn't know where my life was going.
   After some serious self-reflection about my passions and interests, 
   I committed to learning everything I could about machine learning, data science, and the tech industry.
   Beside my studies as a Computer Science Engineering Student at The National School Of Applied Sciences of Tangier, I am becomingh a Data Scientist learning many stuff from machine mearning to data engineering tools. Here I am utilizing my knowledge of machine learning engineering to build intelligent systems to better the customer experience.
